1. Add processing of javascript functions and return results (for jquery precip and temp graphs), editing the source link to point to local downloaded images.
2. Add option and functionality to convert to other formats (pdf).  Easiest wat seems to be using [pdfkit](https://github.com/pdfkit/pdfkit/wiki/Installing-WKHTMLTOPDF) library, but requires [wkhtmltopdf](http://wkhtmltopdf.org/), which needs root/admin access to install.
